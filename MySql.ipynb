    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, managed, and accessed electronically. It is designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage large amounts of data for various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that handle data differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) SQL databases are based on a relational model, where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas.\n",
    "(2) They use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data.\n",
    "(3) They enforce strict data consistency and integrity rules through constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.\n",
    "(4) SQL databases are best suited for structured data and complex relationships between tables.\n",
    "(5) Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data, offering more flexibility and scalability.\n",
    "(2) They provide a variety of data models like key-value pairs, document-based, columnar, and graph databases.\n",
    "(3) NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed schema, allowing for easy scalability and accommodating changing data requirements.\n",
    "(4) They are highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data and high write/read workloads.\n",
    "(5) NoSQL databases are commonly used for big data, real-time analytics, and handling unstructured data.\n",
    "(6) Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Elasticsearch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases lies in their data model, schema flexibility, and scalability. SQL databases are structured, enforce strict schemas, and are suitable for complex relationships. NoSQL databases are more flexible, scalable, and handle unstructured data effectively."

    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each record in that table. It serves as a unique identifier for each row and ensures the uniqueness and integrity of the data in the table. Some key points about primary keys are:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique. No two records can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Non-nullability: The primary key column(s) cannot have null values. Each record must have a valid value in the primary key column(s).\n",

    "(3) Indexing: Primary keys are often automatically indexed by the database system to improve the performance of data retrieval and enforce uniqueness.\n",

    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link or relationship between two tables based on the values of the foreign key column(s) and the referenced primary key column(s). Some key points about foreign keys are:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Relationship establishment: Foreign keys establish relationships between tables by referencing the primary key column(s) of another table. This allows for the creation of logical connections and associations between related data.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Referential integrity: Foreign keys enforce referential integrity, which means that the values in the foreign key column(s) must correspond to valid values in the referenced primary key column(s). This ensures the consistency and accuracy of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Cascading actions: Foreign keys can define cascading actions, such as ON DELETE CASCADE or ON UPDATE CASCADE, which specify what should happen to related records when the referenced primary key is modified or deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Multiple foreign keys: A table can have multiple foreign keys that reference different tables. This allows for complex relationships and data associations between multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
