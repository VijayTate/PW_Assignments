Q1. Create one variable containing following type of data:

my_string = 'my name is Vijay'
my_list = [1,2,3, 'orange','red',True]
my_float = 3.3
my_tuple = (10,20,30,40)




Q2. Given are some following variables containing data: 
(i)	var1 = ‘ ‘ 
(ii) var2 = ‘[ DS , ML , Python]’ 
(iii) var3 = [ ‘DS’ , ’ML’ , ‘Python’ ] 
(iv) var4 = 1.
What will be the data type of the above given variable.

var1 = string
var2 = string
var3 = list
var4 = float




Q3. Explain the use of the following operators using an example:

(i)	/
This operator is used for division. It returns the quotient as a float value.
Example: 
a=10
b=3
print(a/b)
#Output: 3.33

(ii)	%
This operator is used for finding the remainder of the division operation. It returns the remainder as an integer value.
Example:
a=10
b=3
print(a%b)
#Output: 1

(iii)	//
This operator performs division and returns the quotient as an integer, discarding the fractional part.
Example:
a=10
b=3
print(a//b)
#Output: 3

(iv)	**
This operator raises a number to a power. It calculates the result of the base number raised to the power of the exponent.
Example:
a = 2
b = 3
print(a**b)
# Output: 8




Q4. Create a list of length 10 of your choice containing multiple types of data. Using for loop print the element and its data type.

my_list = [10, "Hello", 3.14, True, [1, 2, 3], {"name": "John", "age": 25}, ('a', 'b'), None, 5 + 2j, False]
for element in my_list:
    print(f"Element: {element}, Data Type: {type(element).__name__}")
# Output
Element: 10, Data Type: int
Element: Hello, Data Type: str
Element: 3.14, Data Type: float
Element: True, Data Type: bool
Element: [1, 2, 3], Data Type: list
Element: (10, 20, 30), Data Type: tuple
Element: ('a', 'b'), Data Type: tuple
Element: 0, Data Type: int
Element: (5+2j), Data Type: complex
Element: False, Data Type: bool




Q5. Using a while loop, verify if the number A is purely divisible by number B and if so then how many times it can be divisible.

A = int(input("Enter a value for A: "))
B = int(input("Enter a value for B: "))
# Initialize count to zero
count = 0
# Use a while loop to check if A is divisible by B
while A % B == 0:
    A = A / B
    count += 1
# Check if count is greater than zero
if count > 0:
    print("A is divisible by B ", count, " times.")
else:
    print("A is not divisible by B.")




Q6. Create a list containing 25 int type data. Using for loop and if-else condition print if the element is divisible by 3 or not.

x = [12, 5, 9, 18, 7, 21, 14, 6, 11, 30, 27, 4, 17, 22, 8, 15, 3, 20, 13, 16, 10, 25, 19, 2, 24]
for i in x:
    if i % 3 == 0:
        print(i, "is divisible by 3.")
    else:
        print(i, "is not divisible by 3.")
# Output: 
12 is divisible by 3.
5 is not divisible by 3.
9 is divisible by 3.
18 is divisible by 3.
7 is not divisible by 3.
21 is divisible by 3.
14 is not divisible by 3.
6 is divisible by 3.
11 is not divisible by 3.
30 is divisible by 3.
27 is divisible by 3.
4 is not divisible by 3.
17 is not divisible by 3.
22 is not divisible by 3.
8 is not divisible by 3.
15 is divisible by 3.
3 is divisible by 3.
20 is not divisible by 3.
13 is not divisible by 3.
16 is not divisible by 3.
10 is not divisible by 3.
25 is not divisible by 3.
19 is not divisible by 3.
2 is not divisible by 3.
24 is divisible by 3.
        



Q7. What do you understand about mutable and immutable data types? Give examples for both showing this property.

In Python, data types are classified as either mutable or immutable based on whether their values can be changed after they are created.

Mutable Data Types:
Mutable data types allow modifications to their values even after they are created. Changes to mutable objects are reflected directly in-place without the need to create a new variable.
Examples of mutable data types include lists, sets, and dictionaries.
Example:
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # Modifying the list by adding an element
print(my_list)  
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Immutable Data Types:
Immutable data types, once created, cannot be modified. Modifying an immutable variable actually creates a new variable with the modified value.
Examples of immutable data types include integers, floats, strings, and tuples.
Example:
my_string = "Hello"
my_string = my_string + " World!"  
print(my_string)  
# Output: "Hello World!"
